					<h2>Project Description</h2>
					<p>
						Police shootings in the United States have been controversial for
						many years now. The shootings are often caught on video and can be
						shared widely on social media, leading to protests and debates about
						how police officers should use force in their jobs. police officers
						crimes are highly debated topic in the United States. The Fourth
						Amendment to the Constitution governs the use of lethal force, and
						it is not always clear when it can be used. In general, lethal force
						can only be used when it is required to save a life or avoid major
						injury. The decision whether or not to use lethal force should
						depend on what needs to be done for public safety, not on how
						dangerous a suspect might be. It had been a significant issue for
						many years, with recent events like "the shooting of Michael Brown
						in Ferguson and the shooting of Walter Scott in South Carolina"
						leading to renewed public interest and debate. In the United States,
						there has been an increasing number of police shootings over the
						years. A study conducted in 2016 by The Guardian showed that "black
						people are three times more likely to be killed by police officers
						than white people". There are various causes of this problem. One of
						them is racial bias. It can also be due to a lack of mental health
						services in the community or because African-Americans and Hispanics
						are incarcerated at a much higher rate than their population size
						would suggest. To solve this issue, we need to take a holistic
						approach and address all the factors that lead to these shootings.
						Some ways to solve this issue are: Sign the petition, help stop
						police brutality by becoming a Fatal Encounter Reporter, and Tell
						the Government to Track Police Shootings.
